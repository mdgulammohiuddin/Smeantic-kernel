Workflow Stages and Agent Involvement
1. Input Collection and Preprocessing
Objective: Gather static and dynamic inputs required for FRD generation and preprocess them.
Agents Involved:
Sharepoint Agent (System Agent): Reads static files such as the rules file and FRD template from SharePoint.
S3 Agent (System Agent): Fetches dynamic inputs like call transcripts, emails, and other files from S3 storage.
Config Agent (System Agent): Parses the rules file and FRD template to create a structured framework.
Parallelization:
Sharepoint Agent and S3 Agent work simultaneously to fetch inputs.
Config Agent processes the rules and template in parallel.
Output:
Preprocessed rules, FRD template, and cleaned dynamic inputs.
2. Content Extraction
Objective: Extract relevant content from various input sources based on rules and the FRD template.
Agents Involved:
FRD Agent (Process Agent): Extracts FRD content using rules and the template.
Text Data Cleaning Agent (Process Agent): Cleans and preprocesses textual data (e.g., call transcripts, emails).
Image Processing Agent (Process Agent): Extracts text from images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
File Parsing Agent (Process Agent): Extracts data from structured files like CSV, Excel, PPT, and PDFs.
Parallelization:
Text Data Cleaning Agent, Image Processing Agent, and File Parsing Agent operate concurrently to handle different types of inputs.
FRD Agent consolidates extracted content from all sources.
Output:
Structured and cleaned content ready for integration into the FRD draft.
3. FRD Draft Generation
Objective: Combine all extracted content into the FRD template to create the initial draft.
Agents Involved:
Compose Agent (System Agent): Integrates structured content into the FRD template.
Input:
Structured content from the FRD Agent.
Parsed template structure from the Config Agent.
Output:
Initial FRD draft.
4. Human-in-the-Loop Editing
Objective: Enable human reviewers to refine and edit the initial FRD draft.
Agents Involved:
Human-in-the-Loop Agent (System Agent): Facilitates human review and editing.
Input:
Initial FRD draft.
Output:
Human-edited FRD draft.
5. Version Control and Updates
Objective: Track changes to the FRD and update it with new dynamic inputs.
Agents Involved:
Version Control Agent (System Agent): Maintains version history of the FRD.
Dynamic Input Integration Agent (Process Agent): Monitors new inputs (e.g., additional meetings, emails) and updates the FRD accordingly.
Input:
Human-edited FRD draft.
New dynamic inputs.
Output:
Updated FRD draft with version history.
6. Finalization and Distribution
Objective: Finalize the FRD and distribute it to stakeholders.
Agents Involved:
Email Agent (System Agent): Sends the finalized FRD document to stakeholders.
Input:
Finalized FRD document.
Output:
Email with FRD attached.
